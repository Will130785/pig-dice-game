# Pig Dice Game

Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. As with many games of folk origin, Pig is played with many rule variations. Commercial variants of Pig include Pass the Pigs, Pig Dice, and Skunk. Pig is commonly used by mathematics teachers to teach probability concepts.

In this version two players take it in turns to role the dice and build up their score. The players can hold their current score which is then added to their overall score. Once a player holds, their turn is over and the next player is up.

If a player roles a one, their current score is put back to zero and their turn ends.

The winner is the first player to get their overall score to or beyond the set winning score
